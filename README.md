Objective: 
The main objective of the project was to: 
• Automate the movement of a conveyor belt system. 
• Control the conveyor's start/stop functions based on 
sensor input. 
• Implement ladder logic in a PLC for system control. 
• Increase process efficiency and simulate real-world 
industrial automation scenarios.

Components Used: 
• Laser Sensor(01D106): Used for object detection. 
Provides a digital signal (ON/OFF) based on object 
presence. 
• PLC (6ES7 288-3AM03-0AA0 and 6ES7 288-1SR60
0AA1): The central control unit; executes ladder logic to 
manage conveyor operation. 
• Conveyor Belt System: Mechanically driven belt system 
to transport materials.

Working Principle: 
1. The laser sensor is placed near the conveyor to detect 
objects passing in front of it. 
2. The PLC processes this input based on a pre-written 
ladder logic program. 
3. Depending on the logic: 
o The conveyor shuttle trolly travels from one bunker 
to another on command. 
o The conveyor belt helps to fill the bunker with 
required elements either form back or front. 
4. The system runs in real time, ensuring precise control 
with minimal human intervention. 
 
Applications: 
• Material distribution in the plants. 
• Batch feeding systems in bunkers and silos. 
• Smart warehouse material sorting and allocation.

Outcome and Learnings: 
• Developed a semi-automatic material handling system 
with integrated sensor feedback. 
• Gained proficiency in ladder logic programming for 
complex multi-device control. 
• Understood the real-world application of sensor-actuator 
integration and motor control in an industrial 
environment. 
• Learned the importance of fail-safes, limit checks, and
